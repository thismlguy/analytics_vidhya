    "# Introduction / Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "If an offline model has a better AUC (or any other ML metric) than the production model, is it necessarily better for the business? Does a higher AUC, imply improvement in business metrics? How much improvement in AUC is good enough to justify deployment of a new model and running an A/B test?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the common questions which torment ML practitioners in their daily jobs, specially when building user facing ML products. Some common scenarios behind these concerns are:\n",
    "- ML applications are trying to drive a product which is judged by business metrics like click rates, revenue, engagement, etc. These are dependent on user feedback/interaction in some form which is hard to estimate offline.\n",
    "- ML models are typically deployed along with some business heuristics which control how the model output translates to product action like which song to play or which ad to show.\n",
    "- Many applications chain predictions from multiple models to take an action. For example, the decision of which ad to show could depend on ML models for click rate predictions and demand forecasts along with business constraints like inventory and user eligibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such scenarios, typical ML metrics like accuracy, auc-roc, precision-recall etc for individual models are generally not enough to tell whether an offline model is a significant improvement over the model in production. A/B tests are typically used to do such evaluation but they are expensive to run both in terms of cost and time. Counterfactual evaluation techniques, inspired from causal inference literature, provide a methodology of using production logs to estimate the online metrics like click rate, revenue, etc. Once we have reliable offline estimates, they act act as great first filters on offline models to help decide which ones to A/B test in production."

    "# Advertising Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The example and following mathematical formulation user here is a sligtly toned down version of the example used in [1]. This is not original research, but an attempt to summarize the idea with intuition along with application on simulated data towards the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take an example from advertising world to understand this better. Consider 2 sides of the following scenario:\n",
    "- User side - user visits a website and receives an ad; if the user likes the ad, they clicks on the ad otherwise not\n",
    "- Business side - an ML system receives a request with current user context and picks an ad\n",
    "\n",
    "This system can be defined using the following variables:\n",
    "- user-intent (u): A user visits the website with some intent. Eg, user visits amazon.com to buy a shoe\n",
    "- user-context (x): User starts browsing on the website and their activity is packaged as a context vector\n",
    "- ad inventory (c): Inventory of all ads available to show\n",
    "- bids (b): A system which bids a price per click for ads from the ad inventory\n",
    "- selected_ad (a): A final ad will be selected based on the bids and click estimates\n",
    "- user action (y): Binary 1 if user clicks on the shown ad and 0 otherwise\n",

    "## Causal Graph\n",
    "The system with the above variables can be depicted as a causal graph as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig1-causal_graph.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From this graph, we can observe the dependence/relationship between different variables:\n",
    "- u,v are independent variables, also known as exogenous variables\n",
    "- x = f(u)\n",
    "- b = f(x,v)\n",
    "- a = f(x,b)\n",
    "- y = f(a,u)\n",
    "- z = f(y,b)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understanding, we can model the join probability of the entire system as a probabilistic generative model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(u,v).P(x|u).P(b|x,v).P(a|x,b).P(y|u,a).P(z|y)$$\n",
    "where w is the set of all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we started with independent variables and then chained more variables together following the graph, while conditioning on the variables known at the time of determining a new variable. Note that this is an acyclic graph, i.e. if a causes b, then there is no causal path from b to a."

    "# Modeling Interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, lets say click rate is the business metric we're trying to maximize. Click rate is defined as the proportion of advertisements clicked by users, across user sessions. Suppose we have a production system running and now we develop a new model for selecting an ad, i.e. we have a new way of implementing variable `a`. We want to estimate the click rate of this model as compared to the production model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This system of equations allows us to model interventions as algebraic manipulations i.e. we can change some interim distributions and model a different output for a given input. Refer to Pearl's do-calculus for more details."

    "## Isolation Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, lets understand one of the core assumptions in this model. Like any causal graph, this graph assumes that the exogenous variables don't have any back door path into the netwrok, i.e. there are no common cause between the exogenous variables (u,v) and other variables in the network. For example, suppose an external cause (e) exists which modifies the causal graph as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig2-backdoor-path.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the causal path represented in red are back door paths which invalidate the previously defined system of equations. Another way of stating this assumption is that saying we assume all observations of exogenous variables are independentally sampled from an unknown but fixed joint distribution. This is the isolation assumption. Most causal grahs make this assumption and we might be able to argue practical back door paths which are not accounted for because such causes cannot be measured/modeled. So it is important to be mindful of this assumption while analyzing results."

    "# Counterfactual Analysis\n",
    "Now lets dive in to counterfactual analysis principles and try to answer the question posted above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Counterfactual?\n",
    "\n",
    "The question \"what would happen if we replace a current model M with a new model M'\" is counterfactual in the sense that we are not actually making the change and impacting user experience. We are just trying to estimate business metrics in the scenario if we were to hypothetically deploy the model M'. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analogy to traditional ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets try to compare this scenario with a traditional supervised learning scenario. While training models in a supervised learning setting, we use some independent variables x and true labels y then we try to estimate y as y' = f(x). y' is kind of a counterfactual estimate of what would happend if instead of the system generating the data the model f(x) was used. Then we define a loss function and optimize the model. All this works because f(x) is fully defined which is not the case in our problem i.e. there is no way to know how a user would have interacted if a different ad would be shown. Thus, we need some work-around so that we can estimate the metric without fully defining each component of the system."

    "## Markov Factor Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets try to perform algebraic manipulations in our system of equation. Say we have a new model M' for selection of an ad gived bids. This will impact just one component of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(a|x,b) -> P'(a|x,b)$$\n",
    "The join distribution of the resulting system will be:\n",
    "$$P'(w) = P(u,v).P(x|u).P(b|x,v).P'(a|x,b).P(y|u,a).P(z|y)$$\n",
    "Note that only the one distribution has changed\n",
    "\n",
    "The click rate of the system can be defined as the expectation of click per impression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\int_w yP(w)$$\n",
    "Intuitively, this can be understood as a average of the clicks occuring in different contexts-action scenarios, represented by w, weighted by the probability distribution of w, which is a function of the user activity and production model M.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new model M', the click rate would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r' = \\int_{w} yP'(w)$$\n",
    "To determine click rate for a new model M', we can simply adjust the probability distribution using the new model M given the same inputs from user activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r' = \\int_{w} y\\frac{P'(w)}{P(w)}P(w)$$\n",
    "$$r' = \\int_{w} y\\frac{P'(a|x,b)}{P(a|x,b)}P(w)$$\n",
    "assuming $P(a|x,b)>0$ throughout the domain of w\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the law of large numbers, we can approximate $r'$ as:\n",
    "$$r' \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\frac{P'(a|x,b)}{P(a|x,b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe how we have eliminated most of the components of the system from the final estimate. This is super powerful because now we don't need to fully define the joint distribution $P'(w)$ for the new model M' but only the parts impacted by the intervention/change, which is typically easy to determine as the intervention is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea can be generalized for any given metric $l(w)$, the counterfactual estimate of an offline model M' giving a probability distribution $P'(w)$ can be determined using log data with probability distribution $P(w)$ as:\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "Lets try to understand the concept with a small example. Suppose there are 5 data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| context | p(M) | y | p(M') \n",
    "|------|------|------|------|\n",
    "| w1 | 0.8 | 1 | 0.3 |\n",
    "| w2 | 0.6 | 1 | 0.5 |\n",
    "| w3 | 0.2 | 0 | 0.4 |\n",
    "| w4 | 0.1 | 0 | 0.3 |\n",
    "| w5 | 0.7 | 1 | 0.6 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here each row is a context where an ad was shown. p(M) is the logged probability of showing the ad by the production model M and p(M') is the probaiblity that an offline model M' will show the same ad. y is the user action, 1 if clicked 0 if not. We can observe that the production model usually has a high probability of showing when the user clicked, hence its a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimator will give a similar inference. Whenever there is a show, i.e. $l(w_i)=1$, $P(w)>P'(w)$ hence $r>r'$. Thus we are able to get back our intuitive ordering of models from the counterfactual estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints / Practical Considerations\n",
    "If we carefully observe the final equation, it tends to puts a constraint on the model being evaluated: the model has to be probabilistic in nature and we can determine the probability of taking the exact same action which logging model took, which may not always be trivial. Suppose that we only have the final action a' taken by the new model for each log entry, then we can also re-write the same equation by taking inspiration from propensity score matching based approaches [2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r' \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{l(w_i)\\ \\mathbb{1}(a' == a) }{P(w)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this can be understood as considering the new model to be probabilistic and making $P'(w) = 0$ wherever the new model takes a different action than the logged model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, using the matching approach works if we have a few number of actions and we expect to match a fair number of actions from the logged dataset. However, there are numerous situations scanrios like recommendation, information retrieval, multi-arm bandits where we may not have sufficient data to get enough matches for reliable estimates resulting in high variance. Please note that for the sake of simplicity, we will be not be discussing variance considerations in this article, but feel free to read more in [1] [2]."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "We saw that in case of both the estimators, we were able to estimate the right click rate for each model. In other words, had we now known the actual order of performance of each model, this technique would help us pick the right model just from the predicted outcomes of each model on the logged entries. It is important to note that in this simulated example, we were able to retrieve the exact click rates. But in practice, there could be various sources of noise and we may not get the exact numbers back. However, we could aim for 3 properties, in order of increasing importance, when evaluating offline evaluation methodologies:\n",
    "1. Directionality:\n",
    "    - if online metric for model A > model B, then the counterfactual metric for model A > model B. \n",
    "2. Rate of Change:\n",
    "   - if online metric for model A is 10% more than model B, then the counterfactual metric is also higher by similar amount\n",
    "3. Exact Values:\n",
    "    - the online and counterfactual metrics are very close in absolute value like in our example. This is ideal case\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you find this helpful? Can you think of scenarios in your daily job where this technique could be useful? Do you see any limitations of this approach not highlighted here? Feel free to drop comments with feedback/criticism/questions and I would love to discuss more."
